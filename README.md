# 👋 Hi, I'm Pedro!

I build mobile apps with **Flutter** and **Firebase**. I'm basically a kid who learned to code because I wanted to see my ideas actually come to life. When I’m not building apps, I’m usually messing around with game dev.

---

### 🛠 Tools I use
* **Coding:** Flutter & Dart
* **Backend:** Firebase
* **Design:** Figma
* **Hobbies:** Unity & Roblox Studio

### What I’m up to
* Trying to make my Flutter UIs look cleaner.
* Building my dream game slowly but surely.
* Just making things that look good and work well.
